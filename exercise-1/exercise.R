### -------------------- Exercise 1: Creating data frames --------------------

## Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 5 games
## Hint: google "Seahawks scores", or check the football database:
## http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/seattle-seahawks/results
## here 'Result' displays scores, 'L' stands for loss, 'W' for win
## 
## Hint: feel free to invent if you cannot figure this out
points_scored <- c(31, 38, 35, 38, 20)

## Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be
## scored against them in the first 5 games
points_allowed <- c(23, 31, 30, 25, 30)

## Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
season <- data.frame(points_scored, points_allowed)
season

## Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
season$diff <- season$points_scored - season$points_allowed
season

## Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won
season$won <- season$points_scored > season$points_allowed

## Create a vector of the opponents name (such as "Atlanta Falcons")
opponents <- c("Miami", "Dallas", "New England", "Atlanta", "LA")

## Add the vector of opponents into the data frame
season$opponents <- opponents
